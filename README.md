# FaceEnhancement
For advanced CV project in University of Houston.  Goal is to reimplement the state-of-art paper "Deep Retinex Decomposition for Low-Light Enhancement", and test it on low light faces.     
Here is the paper website: https://daooshee.github.io/BMVC2018website/         
The author also has published its code and dataset. You can find it on above website.        

Result for image decomposition:     
{low Light, normal light, reflectance, illumination}

Result for low light image enhancement:    
{low light, normal light, illumination, enhanced illumination, reconstructed image}
